# Codive in Svelte

### Developing

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and NPM installed.*

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd codive-svelte
npm install
```

...then start webpack:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see Codive running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and the page should reload with your changes.
